The Claw VM is the reference implementation for the a virtual machine following the specifications for
the Claw Development System.
It is written in plain ANSI-C and should run on most platforms almost unmodifed.
The extensive configuration of Claw can be changed using the config.h file and modules can be added to
grant Claw access to the hardware features of the target system.

Best compile this reference-code using CodeLite which is my preferred IDE.

Have fun!
